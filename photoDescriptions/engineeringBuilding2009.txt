In 2009, thanks to generous contributions from notable alumni and benefactors Darlene and Donald Shiley ('51) and Sharon and Ed Sweo ('56), the Engineering building was completely remodeled and expanded, nearly doubling its size. The school was rehoused within its original building and renamed Donald P. Shiley Hall.
