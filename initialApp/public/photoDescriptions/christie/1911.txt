Groundbreaking for Christie Hall, a residence hall for men, named in honor of the founder, Archbishop Alexander Christie, was on June 8, 1911. It was to house 122 students and to include the "temporary" library, an assembly hall, a reception room, recreation rooms and a bowling alley. "All appointments in the building will be thoroughly modern."
