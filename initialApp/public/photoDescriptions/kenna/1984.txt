The hall was renamed for Rev. Howard Kenna, CSC, the 14th President of the University, on November 16, 1973 while it was still serving as a residence for Men. The hall transitioned into a Women's residence from 1984 to 1987, and then again in 2012 to present. The Air Force ROTC Detachment 695 was added to the basement of the Hall in 1976 and is currently still in use.
