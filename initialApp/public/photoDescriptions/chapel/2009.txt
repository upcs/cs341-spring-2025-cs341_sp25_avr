The Bell Tower is our tallest structure at 106 feet; a landmark at a crossroads where faith, academics, and student life intersect. With fourteen bells — each named and baptized and with its own distinct musical voice– The Bell Tower chimes the hour and quarter-hours from 9 to 9 and sounds a call to prayer for Sunday and the daily noon Masses.
