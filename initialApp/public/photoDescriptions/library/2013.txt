The current library was reopened on September 27th, 2013 after being remodeled, renovated, and reimagined for the second time. The library building has changed in size and shape over the years, as well as Clark Library’s services and collections, ever evolving and changing to meet the needs of students, faculty and staff, on campus and beyond, both physically and virtually. It is a library with endless boundaries; always welcome and open to all who seek, learn, and discover.
