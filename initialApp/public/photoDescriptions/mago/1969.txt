In the early morning of April 18, 1969, a five-alarm fire destroyed three wooden buildings in the area where Franz Hall and Mago Hunt Center are today. Lost in the blaze were the Education Hall, Music Hall, and a smaller building that housed offices for The Beacon, student government, AFROTC, and other programs.
