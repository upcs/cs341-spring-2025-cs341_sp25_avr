The Holy Cross Brother Tobias O'Brien beautified the campus in 1916 with flowers and creeping ivy. By 1958 the ivy covered most of the front side of the building and was causing damage to the mortar and bricks. This photo was taken just before the ivy was removed to protect the building from further damages.
