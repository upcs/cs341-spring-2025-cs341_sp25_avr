Originally known as West Hall, Waldschmidt Hall was built in 1891, just a year before this photo was taken. As the first building when the University, formally known as Columbia University until 1935, and it's 25 acres were purchased by Archbishop Alexander Christie, this building once contained the classrooms, dormitory, library, dining hall, Chapel, and offices.
