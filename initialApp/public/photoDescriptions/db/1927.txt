Growth of campus continued and the next major facilities investment was marked with the construction of Howard Hall in 1927. Howard Hall hosted Commencement ceremonies, theater and drama productions, talent shows, boxing, wrestling, dances, and fundraisers. And for years, Howard Hall was the student center with a commuter-student lunch cafeteria, the offices of student government, The Beacon, The Log, and KDUP.
